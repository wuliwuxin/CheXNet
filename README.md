## CXR11 and CXR14

1. [CXR11](https://github.com/wuliwuxin/CTransCNN/blob/main/kaggle.com/competitions/ranzcr-clip-catheter-line-classification/data): In this study, 30,083 CXR image training data were used for multi-label sample classification due to computer limitations.

2. [CXR14](https://github.com/wuliwuxin/CTransCNN/blob/main/nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC): Due to computational limitations, this study performed multi-label sample classification on 51759 CXR images, named CXR14, rather than the complete set of 112120 frontal images.

   **CXR11** and **CXR14** are shown in folders 'open_data/chest11' and 'open_data/chest14'.
